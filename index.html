    <p>John Adam Belushi (January 24, 1949 â€“ March 5, 1982) was an American actor, comedian and singer, and one of the
        seven original cast members of the NBC sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live (SNL). Throughout his career,
        Belushi had a close personal and artistic partnership with his fellow SNL star Dan Aykroyd, whom he met while
        they were both working at Chicago's The Second City comedy club.</p>
    <p>Born in Chicago to Albanian American parents, Belushi started his own successful comedy troupe with Tino Insana
        and Steve Beshekas, called "The West Compass Trio". After being discovered by Bernard Sahlins, he performed with
        The Second City and met Aykroyd, Brian Doyle-Murray and Harold Ramis.</p>
    <p>In 1975, Belushi was recommended to SNL creator and showrunner Lorne Michaels by Chevy Chase and Michael
        O'Donoghue, who accepted Belushi as a new cast member of the show after an audition. He developed a series of
        characters on the show that reached high success, including his performances as Henry Kissinger and Ludwig van
        Beethoven. After his breakout film role as John "Bluto" Blutarsky in National Lampoon's Animal House (1978),
        Belushi later appeared in films such as 1941, The Blues Brothers, and Neighbors. He also pursued interests in
        music, creating with Aykroyd, Lou Marini, Tom Malone, Steve Cropper, Donald "Duck" Dunn, and Paul Shaffer, the
        Blues Brothers, from which the film received its name.</p>
    <p>In his personal life, Belushi struggled with heavy drug use that threatened his comedy career; he was dismissed
        and rehired at SNL on several occasions due to his behavior. In 1982, Belushi died from combined drug
        intoxication caused by Cathy Smith, who injected him with a mixture of heroin and cocaine known as a speedball.
        He was posthumously honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2004.</p>
